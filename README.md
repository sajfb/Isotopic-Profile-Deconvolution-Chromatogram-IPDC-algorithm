# Isotopic-Profile-Deconvolution-Chromatogram-IPDC-algorithm
The IPDC algorithm was developed to screen for a wide variety of organic compounds in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data acquired from instruments with resolution power as low as 22,000 fwhm.

The IPDC algorithm was also employed in the following manuscripts:

To track decadal differences of contaminants in Great Lakes fish: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c03825
To detect mutual contaminants in human sera and fish fillet: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c08507
To evaluate its performance relative to HaloSeeker 1.0: https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03878-y
